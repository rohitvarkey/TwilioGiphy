#TwilioGiphy

This is a website anyone can use to send GIFs to a single phone number. It's like
the Slack Giphy bot but for MMS. This was built using my free trail of the Twilio API.
It was mainly built as a way for me to learn Flask and familiarize myself with the
Twilio REST Client API.

### Acknowledgements

- [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) - For the free trial and the super easy MMS API.
- [Giphy](https://giphy.com/) - For the fantastic translate API.
- [Flaskr](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/tutorial/introduction/) - The Flask tutorial which I've modified to build this.

### Ideas

This could be developed into a social network of sorts were people join the website,
and can subscribe to GIFs posted by others. MMS GIFs for everyone! (Probably a huge
spam hazard in the making though. :stuck_out_tongue:)
